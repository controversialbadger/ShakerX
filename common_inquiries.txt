## Minimum Order Quantity Inquiries

### Template: Addressing Minimum Order Quantity

Dear [Client Name],

Thank you for your inquiry about ordering [BIDONEX/ShakerX] products.

I would like to clarify our minimum order quantities (MOQ):
- For BIDONEX sports bottles: 50 pieces
- For ShakerX products: 56 pieces for the 700ml model and 60 pieces for the 400ml model

These MOQs allow us to maintain competitive pricing while ensuring the highest quality for our custom-printed products. Each order is manufactured specifically for you with your custom design and color preferences.

If you are interested in a smaller quantity, I recommend considering our standard MOQ as it provides the best value for custom products. The price per unit decreases significantly with larger quantities, which you can see in our pricing structure.

Please let me know if you would like a quotation based on our minimum order quantity, or if you have any other questions.
