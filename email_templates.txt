We offer full customization with 1-4 color printing options for logos, branding, and unique designs for Bidonex bottles and 1-3 colors for ShakerX shakers.

## Addressing Color Variations

Dear [Client Name],

Thank you for your interest in our products.

I wanted to inform you that colors might appear slightly different on white versus black [bottles/shakers], due to the opacity of certain colors. This is particularly noticeable with light colors on dark backgrounds.

If precise color matching is crucial for your design, we can perform an underprinting process. This technique is used for colors with poor opacity and would involve an additional fee for extra printing colors.

Alternatively, we can use colors from our verified palette to ensure optimal results.

Please let me know your preference, and I'll be happy to provide updated pricing accordingly.
