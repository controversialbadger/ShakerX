# ORDER PROCESS INFORMATION

## Complete Ordering Process

### 1. Initial Inquiry
- Client contacts us with interest in our products
- We provide general information about our products and services
- We request the client's logo and quantity requirements to prepare a quotation

### 2. Quotation and Visualization
- Upon receiving the client's logo and quantity requirements, we prepare:
  - A free product visualization with the client's logo
  - A detailed quotation based on the product model, quantity, and number of print colors
- The visualization is preliminary and can be adjusted based on client feedback
- We also provide the color palette available for customization

### 3. Order Confirmation
- Client approves the visualization and quotation
- We request the following information to proceed:
  - Full billing address for the Pro Forma Invoice:
    - Company name
    - Address
    - VAT number (for EU clients)
  - Full delivery address:
    - Delivery location name
    - Address
    - Recipient's phone number (required for shipping)

### 4. Payment
- We issue a Pro Forma Invoice with payment details
- Payment is required in advance via bank transfer
- This is because printed bottles/shakers are fully personalized products made to order
- Production begins only after payment confirmation is received

### 5. Production
- After payment confirmation, the order is submitted for approval and processing
- Production time is 7-14 business days for orders up to 500 pieces
- Larger orders may require up to 14 business days
- The production timeline starts from the moment payment is received, not from the date of order placement

### 6. Shipping
- Upon completion of production, the order is shipped
- On the day of shipment, the client receives:
  - Final invoice
  - Tracking link for the shipment
  - Marketing materials to assist in promoting the product

## Important Timeline Considerations

- The fulfillment period is up to 7-14 business days + delivery time (for orders up to 500 pcs)
- Maximum production time is 14 business days for larger orders
- Production time starts from the moment payment is received, not from the date of quotation or order placement
- Shipping time is additional to the production time
- During high-volume periods (e.g., pre-holiday seasons), production times may be longer

## Sample Orders

### Sample Request Process
1. Client requests a sample of our products
2. We require the following information:
   - Billing details for issuing a Pro Forma Invoice (including VAT Number)
   - Delivery address (including the telephone number of the recipient)
3. The cost for sample delivery is 30 EUR net
4. This amount is deducted from the final order total if the client decides to place an order later
5. Samples are selected from previous orders that are most similar to the client's requirements

## Special Order Considerations

### Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ)
- BIDONEX sports bottles: 50 pieces
- ShakerX 700ml: 56 pieces
- ShakerX 400ml: 60 pieces
- ShakerX 400ml 2in1: 48 pieces
- ShakerX 700ml 2in1: 48 pieces

### Color Considerations
- Colors might appear slightly different on white vs. black bottles/shakers due to opacity differences
- For precise color matching, especially with light colors on dark backgrounds, underprinting may be necessary (additional cost)
- We offer a verified color palette to ensure consistent results

### Box Quantities
- Due to our meticulous packaging to ensure products remain undamaged during transportation, orders must be in specific box quantities
- For example, ShakerX 700ml must be ordered in multiples of 56 pieces (1 box)
- For larger orders, we recommend pallet shipping which offers more advantageous pricing

## Order Modifications

- Design adjustments can be made before production begins
- Once production has started, modifications cannot be accommodated
- For color or quantity changes, please inform us before payment is made
