Hi Bartosz,

 

thank your for sending visualization and prices.

 

Atm we still have some water bottles in our store but I am planning to switch them for more eco friendly ones.

 

Could we get a sample of a bottle? The design is not important, I just want to see how it looks like.

 

Thank you,

 

Katarina

for the bottles in case you're interested in them in the future.
Calculation for an order of 56 pieces with a 1-color print below:
ShakerX: 56 pcs. x 2,99 (standard price 4,20) = 167,44 EUR Net + Delivery IT (1 box)
30 EUR net
Total: 197,44 EUR net

*The mentioned price already include 1 print color. For an additional print color, +
0,50 EUR /pc. will be charged.

Due to our meticulous packaging to ensure the shakers remain undamaged during
transportation, the quantity of shakers per carton must be 56 pieces.

The calculation would then be as follows:

for your shipment and marketing materials to assist you in promoting your product, for
example, on your website.

To receive an estimated quotation, please send me your logo in vector format or high-quality

Then I'll be able to prepare the visualization and quotation for you.
Regarding the points you raised:
We do not offer free delivery.
This is a cost borne by the customer.
We offer delivery through DPD at a price of 30 EUR net per box (DE).
For an order of 224 pieces (4 boxes), the delivery cost amounts to 120 EUR net.
If the customer has the option to arrange the delivery process independently, that is certainly
possible.
The payment for the order is made by issuing a pro forma document by us, followed by the
customer making a bank transfer.
Printed shakers are a fully personalized product made to order, so we only accept payment
in advance.
The price of 2.99 EUR net per piece for a shaker applies to shakers with single-color printing.
If the customer's logo requires additional colors, the charge for each additional color is 0.50 EUR
net per piece.
This is related to the production process, as each additional color requires a new matrix and
screen.
We offer sample shaker shipping.
In this case, there is a charge of 30 EUR net for delivery.
Samples are selected from previous orders that we have in stock and are most similar to the
client's visualization.
In the event that you decide to place an order later, the 30 EUR net amount paid to cover the
delivery costs is deducted from the final order total.
To place an order for samples, we need the following data:
‚Ä¢ Billing details for issuing a pro forma invoice (Please include VAT Number)
‚Ä¢ Delivery address (Please include the telephone number of the recipient)
Good morning,
Attached are marketing materials in the form of graphics that you can use

Dear,
Please find attached the version with your specified Pantone color.
I have confirmed with the production manager that the Pantone color will not alter its shade on the white
shaker.
However, on the black shaker, the color will appear darker due to the poor opacity of yellow.
Although the color will still look good, you will notice a difference between the print on the white and
black shakers.
If this variation is not a concern for you, we can proceed with this color. Alternatively, we can use colors

from our verified palette (see attachment).
In that case, the pricing will be as follows:
1.
ShakerX (672 units) (1 color print ‚Äì Yellow logo)
ShakerX 672 units x 3,29 EUR = 2 210,88 EUR Net
ShakerX (336 units) (2 color print ‚Äì Black+Red logo)
ShakerX 336 units x 3,29 EUR = 1 105,44 EUR Net
Additional color print = 0,50 eur x 336 = 168 EUR net
Shipping = 410 EUR net
Total = 3894,32 EUR net
Should you prefer to achieve a perfectly consistent shade, we can perform an underprint.
This process is used for colors with poor opacity and would involve an additional fee for three printing
colors (white, yellow, and masking).
The pricing for this option is as follows:
2.
ShakerX (672 units) (3 colors print ‚Äì Yellow logo)
ShakerX 672 unit x 3.29 EUR = 2210.88 EUR Net
Additional color charge = 1,00 eur x 672 = 672.00 EUR Net
ShakerX (336 units) (2 color print ‚Äì Black+Red logo)
ShakerX 336 units x 3,29 EUR = 1 105,44 EUR Net
Additional color print = 0,50 eur x 336 = 168 EUR net
Shipping = 410 EUR net
Total = 4 566,32 EUR net
In addition, I wanted to inform you that we offer pallet shipping for larger orders.
This allows us to provide a more advantageous pricing structure.
For this reason, I can offer you an order of 1,344 units, which we would dispatch using two smaller
pallets.
This approach would significantly reduce the cost per unit.
Calculations below:
1.
ShakerX (672 units) (1 color print ‚Äì Yellow logo)
ShakerX 672 units x 2,99 EUR = 2 009,28 EUR Net
ShakerX (672 units) (2 color print ‚Äì Black+Red logo)
ShakerX 672 units x 2,99 EUR = 2 009,28 EUR Net
Additional color print = 0,50 eur x 672 = 336 EUR net
Shipping = 500 EUR net
Total = 4 854,56 EUR net

2.
ShakerX (672 units) (3 colors print ‚Äì Yellow logo)
ShakerX 672 unit x 2,99 EUR = 2 009,28 EUR Net
Additional color charge = 1,00 eur x 672 = 672.00 EUR Net
ShakerX (672 units) (2 color print ‚Äì Black+Red logo)
ShakerX 672 units x 2,99 EUR = 2 009,28 EUR Net

Part 5: Advanced Considerations and Core Selling Points

Subject: Advanced Customer Considerations and Core Selling Points

Dear [Client Name],

This email provides you with some advanced considerations and summarizes the core selling points for both Bidonex and ShakerX products to further enhance your customer interactions.

A. Advanced Considerations:

Addressing Color Variations:

Be aware that colors might appear slightly different on white vs. black bottles/shakers, due to the opacity of certain colors (as seen in the example with yellow).

If precise color matching is crucial, especially with light colors on dark backgrounds, mention the possibility of underprinting, which comes with additional costs.

Offer to match colors from our verified color palette if needed.

Managing Expectations on Lead Times:

Always emphasize that the lead time (7-14 business days) starts from the moment the payment is received, not from the date of the quote or order placement.

Politely but firmly explain any reasons for delays due to high volumes, pre-holiday periods, or other unexpected circumstances.

Clarifying Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ):

Reiterate that the minimum order quantity for Bidonex sports bottles is 50 pieces, and for ShakerX products, it's 56/60 pieces, depending on model.

Explain that these MOQs are in place to ensure the most competitive pricing for personalized products.

If a client wants a smaller quantity, explain that it's not possible and the order must meet the MOQs

Delivery Options & Costs:

Offer the option for clients to arrange their own shipping if preferred.

Clearly state that the delivery cost is extra and depends on the order size and destination.

If applicable, explain the benefits of pallet shipping for larger orders, offering better pricing.

DPD shipping usually costs 30 EUR net per box (for DE delivery, please reconfirm with the client).

Payment Terms:

Reiterate that payment is required upfront via pro forma invoice, due to the custom nature of the products.

Printed bottles/shakers are custom made to order and payment in advance is necessary.

Handling Sample Requests:

Be clear about the delivery charge for samples (30 EUR net), which is non-refundable but deductible from future order if an order is made.

Explain that samples are selected from previous orders that are in stock, and that samples may vary from the exact customisation of the client.

Full Customization Options:

Emphasize that the bottle, cap and top can be customised and the colour can be mixed and matched from a standard 12 color palette (Bidonex).

Clear Communication About Changes:

Be transparent about reasons for any changes to an agreement. Manage client expectations effectively.

Be prepared to explain any changes in the prices due to printing or logistical differences.

Pricing Tiers:

Remind clients that the price per unit will fall when the amount of the order increases, encourage larger orders.
