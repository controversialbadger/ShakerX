Hello Jakub,

Unfortunately, the minimum per design is 50 pieces.

Yes, we do have transparent bottles.

## Example 4: Addressing Color Variations and Offering Solutions

**Client:** [Client asks about using a specific Pantone color on both white and black shakers]

**Response:**
```
Dear [Client],

Please find attached the version with your specified Pantone color.

I have confirmed with the production manager that the Pantone color will not alter its shade on the white shaker.

However, on the black shaker, the color will appear darker due to the poor opacity of yellow.

Although the color will still look good, you will notice a difference between the print on the white and black shakers.

If this variation is not a concern for you, we can proceed with this color. Alternatively, we can use colors from our verified palette (see attachment).

In that case, the pricing will be as follows:

1.
ShakerX (672 units) (1 color print – Yellow logo)
ShakerX 672 units x 3.29 EUR = 2,210.88 EUR Net
ShakerX (336 units) (2 color print – Black+Red logo)
ShakerX 336 units x 3.29 EUR = 1,105.44 EUR Net
Additional color print = 0.50 EUR x 336 = 168.00 EUR Net
Shipping = 410.00 EUR Net
Total = 3,894.32 EUR Net

Should you prefer to achieve a perfectly consistent shade, we can perform an underprint.
This process is used for colors with poor opacity and would involve an additional fee for three printing colors (white, yellow, and masking).

The pricing for this option is as follows:

2.
ShakerX (672 units) (3 colors print – Yellow logo)
ShakerX 672 unit x 3.29 EUR = 2,210.88 EUR Net
Additional color charge = 1.00 EUR x 672 = 672.00 EUR Net
ShakerX (336 units) (2 color print – Black+Red logo)
ShakerX 336 units x 3.29 EUR = 1,105.44 EUR Net
Additional color print = 0.50 EUR x 336 = 168.00 EUR Net
Shipping = 410.00 EUR Net
Total = 4,566.32 EUR Net
```

## Example 5: Handling Timeline Expectations

**Client:** [Client asks about delivery timeline, suggesting they were promised a faster delivery]

**Response:**
```
Dear [Client],

Thank you for your message regarding the delivery timeline for your order.

I'd like to clarify that our standard production time is 7-14 business days after payment confirmation, as mentioned in our previous correspondence dated [date]. Your payment was received on [actual payment date], which means the production timeline started from that date.

While we always strive to fulfill orders as quickly as possible, the production schedule is determined by the payment confirmation date, not the date of the initial quote or order placement.

We currently have your order scheduled for shipment by [specific date], which is within our standard production timeline. We understand the importance of receiving your products promptly, and we're working diligently to ensure your order is completed with the highest quality standards.

If you have any urgent concerns, please let me know, and I'll see if there's any possibility to expedite the process.

Kind Regards,
