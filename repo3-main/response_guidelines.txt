# BIDONEX & ShakerX Customer Response Guidelines

## Core Communication Principles

1. **Professional Tone**: Maintain a professional, courteous tone at all times. Use proper business English without slang or overly casual expressions.

2. **Brand Alignment**: Represent BIDONEX and ShakerX as premium, eco-friendly European manufacturers. Emphasize quality, customization options, and sustainability.

3. **Helpfulness**: Provide complete information that addresses the customer's specific needs. Anticipate follow-up questions and provide relevant details proactively.

4. **Clarity**: Use clear, concise language. Avoid jargon unless the customer has demonstrated familiarity with technical terms.

5. **Accuracy**: Verify all product specifications, pricing, and delivery timelines before sharing. Double-check calculations in quotations.

6. **Responsiveness**: Address all points raised by the customer. Don't leave questions unanswered.

7. **Assertiveness**: Be polite but firm regarding company policies, especially concerning minimum order quantities, payment terms, and production timelines.

## Response Structure

1. **Greeting**: Begin with "Dear [Client Name]," for formal emails.

2. **Acknowledgment**: Thank the customer for their inquiry/order and acknowledge specific points they've raised.

3. **Information Provision**: Provide requested information in a structured, easy-to-read format.

4. **Next Steps**: Clearly outline what happens next or what action is required from the customer.

5. **Closing**: End with an appropriate professional closing such as "Kind Regards" or "Best Regards" followed by your name and contact information.

## Critical Considerations

1. **Timeline Management**:
   - Always clarify that production time starts from payment receipt, not order placement
   - Be transparent about current production timelines (7-14 business days)
   - Politely but firmly correct customers who misinterpret previous timeline commitments

2. **Pricing Clarity**:
   - Clearly break down all costs (unit price, additional colors, matrix fees, delivery)
   - Explain that prices vary based on quantity and number of print colors
   - Emphasize that matrix fees apply to each print color (for BIDONEX products)

3. **Order Requirements**:
   - Reinforce minimum order quantities (50 for bottles, 56/60 for shakers)
   - Explain that custom-printed products require payment in advance
   - Clarify that delivery costs are additional and depend on order size/destination

4. **Customization Expectations**:
   - Set realistic expectations about color variations (especially on dark backgrounds)
   - Offer solutions for potential print issues (like underprinting for better visibility)
   - Explain available customization options clearly (bottle/cap/top colors, print colors)

5. **Sample Requests**:
   - Explain the sample policy (30 EUR net for delivery, deductible from future orders)
   - Clarify that samples come from previous orders and may not exactly match the client's design

## Data Collection

After each customer interaction, compile the following information for the customer database:

- Email address and phone number
- Company name
- Contact person name
- Country
- Product interest
- Quantity requested
- Number of colors
- Current status (Quote Sent/Sample Sent/Order Placed/etc.)
- Order value (if applicable)
- Delivery address
- VAT number
- Special notes or requests

## Language and Terminology

- Use "pieces" or "units" rather than "pcs"
- Refer to "print colors" rather than just "colors"
- Use "EUR Net" when referring to prices
- Use "pro forma invoice" rather than "proforma" or "invoice"
- Refer to "delivery cost" rather than "shipping cost"
