Thank you for your question regarding printing options.

We offer full customization with 1-4 color printing options for logos, branding, and unique designs for Bidonex bottles and 1-3 colors for ShakerX shakers.

Please note that prices depend on quantity and the number of print colors. For light colors on dark backgrounds, we may recommend underprinting for better visibility, which would count as an additional color.

### Template 10: Addressing Color Variations

Subject: Re: Color Variations - [Company Name]

Dear [Client Name],

Thank you for your inquiry about color variations.

I have confirmed with our production manager that your specified color will not alter its shade on light-colored products. However, on dark-colored products, the color may appear darker due to the poor opacity of certain colors.

We have two options to address this:
1. Proceed with the current color selection, understanding there will be a noticeable difference between prints on light and dark backgrounds.
2. Use underprinting to achieve a more consistent shade across all products. This process involves an additional print color and would incur an additional charge of [Price] EUR Net per piece.

Please let me know which option you prefer.
