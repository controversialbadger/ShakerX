## Example 3: Follow-up Question About Design Options

### Customer Inquiry:
```
Hi,

I understand, it's it possible to have 2 different design for one order 50 unites? Do you have also transparent bidon si you can see how much in is missing? Or is it visible trhought the white one? ðŸ™ƒ

Thank you
```

### Professional Response:
```
Hello Jakub,

Unfortunately, the minimum per design is 50 pieces. Each design requires its own production setup, which is why we maintain this minimum quantity per design.

Regarding your question about transparent bottles - yes, we do have transparent bottles available. The transparent bottles allow you to clearly see the liquid level inside, which is not visible through the white bottles.

I've attached an image of our recent transparent bottle realization for your reference.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with either the white or transparent bottles, or if you have any other questions.

Kind Regards,
